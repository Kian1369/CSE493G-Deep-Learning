## Goals
In this project, I will write backpropagation code and train Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

* Understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures.
* Understand and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation.
* Implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks.
* Implement Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization for training deep networks.
* Implement Dropout to regularize networks.
* Understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and get practice with training them.
* Gain experience with a major deep learning framework, PyTorch.
* Explore various applications of image gradients, including saliency maps, fooling images, class visualizations.
