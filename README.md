# CSE493G-Deep-Learning

Deep Learning has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization, and detection and language understanding tasks like summarization, text generation, and reasoning. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art systems.

In this repo, I will investigate the details of deep learning algorithms, architectures, tasks, and metrics, with a focus on learning end-to-end models. I will begin by grounding deep learning advancements, particularly for the task of **image classification**; later, I will generalize these ideas to many other tasks. In this repository, I will implement and train my neural networks to illustrate a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in deep learning. The final assignment will hopefully be an opportunity to train and apply multi-million parameter networks on real-world vision problems that I will select. Through multiple hands-on assignments and the final course project, I will show the toolset for setting up deep learning tasks and practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning deep neural networks.
