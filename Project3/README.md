## Goals
In this assignment, I will implement language networks and apply them to image captioning on the COCO dataset. Then I will train a Generative Adversarial Network to generate images that look like a training dataset. Finally, I will be introduced to self-supervised learning to automatically learn the visual representations of an unlabeled dataset.

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

* Understand and implement RNN and Transformer networks. Combine them with CNN networks for image captioning.
* Understand how to train and implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce images that resemble samples from a dataset.
* Understand how to leverage self-supervised learning techniques to help with image classification tasks.
