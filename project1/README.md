## Goals
In this assignment, I will be putting together a simple **image classification** pipeline based on the **k-nearest Neighbor** or the **SVM/Softmax classifier**. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

*Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages).
*Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
*Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy.
*Implement and apply a k-nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier.
*Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
*Implement and apply a Softmax classifier.
*Implement and apply a Two-layer neural network classifier.
*Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers.
*Get a basic understanding of performance improvements by using higher-level representations as opposed to raw pixels, e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features, etc.
